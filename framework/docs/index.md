Ansible UI Framework

# Ansible UI Framework

A framework for building applications using [PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org).

- [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md)
- [Guides](Guides.md)
- [Components](Components.md)

The framework is made up of high level components abstracting design patterns away from the PatternFly components used underneath.

This framework:

- does not use any state libraries other than the built in react context state management.
- does not assume any specific translation libraries, but does provide a hook for internal translations.
- does not assume any specific navigation libraries, but does provide a hook for internal navigation.

There is an [Ansible UI Framework Demo](https://github.com/jamestalton/ansible-ui-framework-demo) repo showing an example of using the framework.
