Ansible UI Framework

# Ansible UI Framework

A framework for building applications using [PatternFly](https://www.patternfly.org).

- [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md#getting-started)
- [Guides](Guides.md#ansible-ui-guides)
- [Components](Components.md#ansible-ui-components)

The framework is made up of high level components using PatternFly components underneath.
This allows the framework to adjust the web application for responsive layout.

The framework:

- does not use any state libraries other than the built in react context state management.
- does not assume any specific translation libraries, but does provide a hook for internal translations.
- does not assume any specific navigation libraries, but does provide a hook for internal navigation.
  There is an [Ansible UI Framework Demo](https://github.com/jamestalton/ansible-ui-framework-demo) repo showing an example of using the framework.
